    <strong>Operate Systemair SAVE series of devices, expose them as auto-discoverable MQTT devices</strong>
  </p>

</div>

This package provides a collection of tools to operate [Systemair SAVE air heat recovery
units][mfct]. The tools range from as simple as printing the documented and undocumented Modbus
registers known to this tool, to reading and writing those registers, to exposing the control of
the unit over MQTT as a device adhering to the [Homie
convention](https://homieiot.github.io/specification/). The MQTT functionality makes it much more
straightforward to expose the air handling unit for integration with home automation systems such
as OpenHAB, Home Assistant or NodeRED.

The tool collection is available as a standalone, dependency-free executable download for the three
major platforms (Windows, MacOS, Linux.)

Currently communication over TCP via the SystemAIR IAM module or another Modbus gateway is
supported.
